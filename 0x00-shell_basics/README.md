# A Lesson In Shell-Scripting

Shell scripting is an important part of process automation in Linux. Scripting helps you write a sequence of commands in a file and then execute them.
This saves you time because you don't have to write certain commands again and again. You can perform daily tasks efficiently and even schedule them for automatic execution.
You can also set certain scripts to execute on startup such as showing a particular message on launching a new session or setting certain environment variables.
